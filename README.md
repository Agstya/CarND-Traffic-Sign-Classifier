Overview
---
In this project, I used convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model that can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

The model gives an accuracy of 98.57% on validation set and 97.64% on test set.

For more details, please refer to the [Ipython notebook here]().
